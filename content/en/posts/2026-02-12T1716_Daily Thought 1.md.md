I was on public transport, wondering what I could do to keep from tiring my mind too much. I decided to find a way to post texts to this blog, even from my phone.

I’ve known for a while that it was possible. But until now, I didn’t see the point. Coding on a phone has never interested me.
I’m thinking of writing a specific article to explain how to do this. It would give more clarity to what I want to achieve. Furthermore, I plan to organize everything by folders so it remains readable in the long run.

So today, I learned one more thing than what is taught at university. Specifically, the real utility of **SSH keys**. It was interesting.

Since my recent shift, I’ve started using **Anki**, an application that helps memorize things over the long term. It’s for the local open-source side of things (if you’re on anything other than an iPhone, don’t hesitate to check it out). I will also probably make a guide for using Anki, where I’ll select a specific setup to share here.

I’m paying more and more attention to my app consumption on the internet. I prefer using open-source tools, like Markor, which I’m currently using to write this thought.

For over two weeks now, I haven’t been using social media in the usual way. I stay on them for messages from my social circle. The rest doesn’t interest me.
I consider it *junk* dopamine designed to drug us enough to make us forever dependent on these psychologically aggressive ecosystems.

I’ve been thinking about deleting everything for a while. Finding a more honorable alternative. At first, I thought the fact that no one would follow me was a problem. In the end, I think if everyone thought that way, the monopoly of networks as they currently are would never be challenged.

It’s the fight of an ant against a titan. But I’d rather fight it than give up.
Still, I think simply quitting these platforms isn’t effective.
We must first create communities, then migrate them to open platforms.

I haven't seriously thought about it yet. Nor have I analyzed the alternatives available to me.
But I think the platforms that will host these communities must be particularly welcoming, and therefore have a user experience as close as possible to the old ones.

Yes, we aren't removing the *junk* dopamine problem, but at least the data of these millions of people won’t necessarily be monetized without their knowledge.

I still believe that eventually, implementing preventive courses against the dangers of the new world will be necessary for the younger generations.

### Rest of the Day

It’s February 12th. I’m working tomorrow. So I went to get Caramel’s gift. I’m seeing her the day after tomorrow. I hope she likes what I bought her. I’ll specify what it is in the next daily if I don’t forget. I’m not saying it now: since she knows I’m writing a blog, she might stumble upon this text.

Coming back from the shop, as I entered the station, I crossed paths with a lady carrying a large shopping trolley up the stairs. I thought about the situation and, in a burst of courage, I decided to help her. If I don't help a woman alone in a station, how could I pretend to change anything dissonant in this world? Seeing someone struggling and doing nothing feels a bit disturbing to me.

I was satisfied to have helped her, though I was very embarrassed to receive her thanks. I didn’t do it to be thanked. I did it because it was the right thing to do. I just hope that in the future, I will still have the courage to help those who need it.

If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading.
Take care of yourself and your mind.
