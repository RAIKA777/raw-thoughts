It would be wise for me to introduce myself to those reading this blog before discussing anything else. But first, I want to clarify that this text was thought out and written in French before being translated into English. *Why English?* Not out of any dislike for French, I appreciate the language deeply. It is simply a matter of accessibility. English is the universal language, and this blog aims to convey information to as many people as possible. Or, at the very least, to transmit ideas that I believe are worth preserving and sharing.

I am not Aaron Swartz. I do not expect to have an audience. This blog will probably never be read by anyone other than myself. The era of blogging is over. But watching the documentary *The Internet’s Own Boy* motivated me to write this. Because I sincerely believe in Aaron's ideas.

> Information is Power.

I introduce myself as **Raika**. I think a pseudonym is sufficient; after all, it is not my civil identity that I wish to highlight here. It is simply my thoughts regarding what is happening in my life, about the system in which I evolve. I live in France, near Paris. I am, therefore, in direct contact with *the West*. I specify this because I am not originally from here.

Twelve days ago, I made a change in my life. I no longer consume "fast" dopamine sources, which I like to call *Junk Dopamine*. I will elaborate on the reasons for this elsewhere. After all, this is just an introduction.

I am currently in my third year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (L3). I am passionate about networking, cybersecurity, and open source. But I am also interested in subjects that have nothing to do with my formal education, such as ethology, sociology, and psychology. I consider myself a novice in each of these fields and have no pretension of being an expert or someone qualified to teach others. I am sharing my knowledge and my interests; this blog is a modest contribution to that great act of sharing. I am aware that there are far more efficient methods to do this, and I hope one day to have the skills to utilize them. I am training for that, though I find my pace to be slow. I prefer it to be steady rather than rushed and short-lived.

In 2026, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to read. I haven't read all of Aaron’s memoirs myself. I will read them, not all, but the essentials. I suppose the point of reading a blog is also to follow a person's journey. Personally, I don't think reading me is particularly interesting. I write; one day I might be someone who has actually done something (probably not). I am quite pessimistic about that. I try to contribute to promoting the liberation of knowledge, entertainment, and all those intangible things that could be unlimited and free for everyone.

I believe that if each of us thought this way, there would be nothing we couldn't obtain without swiping a card at a corporate terminal. I appreciate the *Warez scene*. My shift in perspective occurred after I became aware of this *organization*. It has been nearly two months now. When I learned about Aaron's existence and his story, he became the *avatar* for ideas I had instinctively adhered to in the past—ideas that have, at times, tortured my mind.

There are many things I want to discuss here, but I think it would be straying too far for a simple introduction. Besides, it is getting late.

So, Good Night World.
One day, I will be competent enough to be more useful. (I hope).
